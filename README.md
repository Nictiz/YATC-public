# Nictiz repository: `YATC-public`

-------

2024-03-12 This repository is the default publication location for code compiled out of the repository [HL7-mappings](https://github.com/Nictiz/HL7-mappings). When a new publication is added to this repository, the code is committed as-is, and zipped. The zip allows easy download, while the code commit allows easy inspection of what changed.

## Background
Since 2022 we have been working on major restructuring to better separate code from data. We have also replaced most of the ant powered toolchain with a brand new tool we dubbed yatc (Yet Another ToolChain). At publication time the yatc tool assembles all required parts for a given use case. The older publications will not be moved or copied here. Over time they will just loose relevance as they are superseded by newer releases in this repository
