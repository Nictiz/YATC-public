# Directory `YATC-public/ada-2-fhir-r4/sch/fhir-schematrons/`

This directory contains the Schematron schemas used in validating the `ada-2-fhir-r4` results.

IMPORTANT (202305): There are some issues with the provenance of the schemas (and maybe with their versions):

* The provenance of the `bundle.sch` schema is a download from [https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/fhir-all-xsd.zip](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/fhir-all-xsd.zip) (a link to this and more is [here](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/downloads.html)). 
* The provenance of the `fhir-invariants.sch` schema is unclear. The download menioned in the bullet above also contains a Schematron schema with this filename, but this schema is *invalid*.
