compare-ada-2-fhir-r4

TBD TBD INCORRECT!

Compares the documents produced by the new ada-2-wiki with the ones
produced by the original art_decor Ant scripts.

Command line options:
-help                           
    Display this help text
application version --nodirs]
    Actually compare the production documents for an application/version.
    To get all versions/applications, use #all.
    -nodirs disables full directory compares.
